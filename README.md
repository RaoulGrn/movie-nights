# MovieNights

This project was made with React and Vite. The purpose of this app is to help you make a favorite movies list, based on personal ratings ( and to help me learn State Management). There is no back-end, the movies are saved in the browser's local storage.

# Setup

Open a terminal and use "npm run start" in the root folder.
